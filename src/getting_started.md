# Getting Started

This guide is intended to serve as a deep dive into video and audio encoding for amateurs/enthusiasts.
The beginning parts of the guide assume that you have little previous experience with video encoding.
The deeper parts of the guide build upon the earlier parts--advanced users may feel more comfortable skipping forward in the guide.

The guide can be navigated in any of the following ways:

- The left and right arrows on the sides of the screen
- The left arrow and right arrow keys on the keyboard
- The collapsible table of contents
