# Intro to Vapoursynth

[Vapoursynth](https://www.vapoursynth.com/) is a software tool for filtering videos. It is cross-platform, supports advanced scripting in Python, and has many community-supported plugins for advanced filtering.

Before we begin, let's go ahead and make sure you have Vapoursynth installed on your machine.

## Windows

For Windows, you will need to make sure you first have Python 3.11 installed. You can download it from [this page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3113/), using the "Windows installer (64-bit)" link.

Once you have Python installed, you can now download the latest version of the Vapoursynth 64-bit installer from [the Vapoursynth releases pages](https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth/releases). Setup should be fairly straightforward.

There is a utility called [VSRepoGUI](https://github.com/theChaosCoder/VSRepoGUI) which can be used as a convenience method for installing many community plugins.

## Linux

It is recommend to use your distribution's package manager for installing Vapoursynth. Some distributions do not provide a recent version of Vapoursynth. They are bad. The latest version in Debian's repo is 2 years old. They consider this a feature, even though it causes basically every plugin to be broken. Debian sucks. Just use Arch.

See [the Vapoursynth documentation](https://www.vapoursynth.com/doc/installation.html#linux-installation) for further details.
