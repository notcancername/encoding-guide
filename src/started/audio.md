# Audio Formats

Similar to video, there are dozens of audio compression formats that have been used over the decades.
Historically, the most widely known has been MP3, but this has hardly ever been used in video,
and is now antiquated for music as well. The following are the current most widely used formats
for audio _in videos_. (This guide is _not_ intended to cover encoding music tracks, although
much of the advice here will still apply similarly.)

## Lossless Encoding

The use of lossless encoding is a bit more common with audio, due to the fact that a losslessly encoded audio track is relatively small compared to a losslessly encoded video track. The distribution of lossless audio is still relatively rare, but it will occasionally be seen, whereas it is incredibly rare for lossless video to be distributed.
