# Audio Formats

Similar to video, there are dozens of audio compression formats that have been used over the decades.
Historically, the most widely known has been MP3, but this has hardly ever been used in video,
and is now antiquated for music as well. The following are the current most widely used formats
for audio _in videos_. (This guide is _not_ intended to cover encoding music tracks, although
much of the advice here will still apply similarly.)
