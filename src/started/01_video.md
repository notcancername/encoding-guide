# Video Formats

Before we can begin encoding, we have to have a basic understanding of what encoding _is_.
Encoding is essentially compressing the video or audio so that it results in a smaller file.
This is similar to what you might have done with .rar or .zip files, the difference being
that video and audio encoders are highly specialized, allowing for far greater compression
than a generic format could give.

There have been hundreds of video compression formats across the decades, but as technology has advanced,
allowing the creation of better and better formats, this guide will only cover formats that are still worthwhile
for encoding today.
